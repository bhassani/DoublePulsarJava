# DoublePulsarJava
Doublepulsar interface application written in Java<br /><br />
This application written by Github User: jonyluke currently determines if the target is vulnerable to MS17-010 (EternalBlue) and detects the presence of DoublePulsar.<br />
<br />
Future goals: create a program that uploads shellcode to doublepulsar to open notepad or calculator, then a program to allow uploading of DLL files.
<br />TODO: create NetBIOS, SMB, Trans2 structure <br />
